Image files extracted from the games should be placed in subdirectories under the data/ folder.

Each subfolder of images also needs a `game.ctl` file, which is the text that makes up the header for each tweet.  Example game.ctl from a Myst subdirectory:

    Game: Myst (1993, Mac/Win)
    By: Cyan / Br√∏derbund
    Region: Myst Island
